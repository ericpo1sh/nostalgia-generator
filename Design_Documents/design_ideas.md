## What is it you’re going to build and how does it fit the theme?

- We are building a nostalgia memory generator. The user is prompted with a box to enter in their desired year and then the API gets the information from the request and pulls up data that correlates with the year. After that, the user can see a list of songs, things, and historic events that happened that year. This fits perfectly with the theme because it’s something to do with nostalgia.

## What tools will you use?

- The tools that we will be using are React, CSS/HTML, JavaScript, JSON, MongoDB, REST API, Bootstrap.

## How long do you expect to spend on development of each part?

- Frontend: 1-2 business days.
- Backend: 3-4 business days.
- Database: 1-2 business days.
- API: 1-2 business days.

Initially we decided to go with a more simple design and have one input. Based off of the value of the input, we will extract that information, dynamically send it over to our API and retrieve the corresponding data with that year and send it back with the API to the UI. Our UI will use pagination in order to fit all of the data that we want onto the screen.
